# Documentation project archetypes

<!-- This is a stub while we write the individual entries. -->

_Documentation project archetypes_ is a tool to help open source software maintainers identify and plan open source documentation work.

Each archetype is intended to help you direct resources, such as your time, your contributors’ time, or grant funding, toward completing meaningful improvements to your software project’s docs, documentation tools, and process.

From conducting user research to editing old docs, each archetype gives you some hints on how to recognize that project type (and its alternatives), plan it, and avoid major problems. These are not fully realized project plans; rather, they are an aid for making plans that are exactly suited to your software project’s needs.
